# HW 4â€”Knowledge Base


## Overview

This is a two-part homework. In Part 1, you are going to create a basic knowledge base (KB) to store and retrieve facts, and in Part 2, you are going to extend the KB and create an inference engine. Please note that both parts should NOT take you equal time to complete; Part 2 is the bigger of the two parts, requiring more effort than on Part 1.
